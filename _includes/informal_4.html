    &emsp;&emsp;In his book on scale, Geoff West uses scaling theory to analyze human development, through case studies of cities, companies, and social networks. Like Owen Barder, West believes that human development is a complex adaptive system. West began his analysis by discussing metabolism, growth, and fatality in organisms. Each living being needs a continuous supply of energy to undergo metabolism, but the entropy that results from metabolic processes puts wear and tear on the system, inevitably killing the organism. Considering the basal metabolic rate of difference sized organisms led us into the concept of economies of scale, and considering growth led us into the concept of highly complex, self-sustaining structures undergoing nonlinear scaling. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;With this knowledge, we can look at West’s first case study, the company. First, he noticed that companies underwent the same power law scaling that biological organisms experience. They grow rapidly in earlier years, but growth tapers off as they mature, and finally, they stop growing relative to the GDP.  Similar to their biological counterparts, companies are also subject to economies of scale and sublinear scaling. These economies of scale and sublinear scaling eventually dominate the innovation and ideas that are associated with superlinear scaling, eventually leading to stagnation and in many cases, mortality. In fact, West even went so far as to say that in companies, “Growth leads to unidimensionality, driven by market forces and ossification of administrative and bureaucratic needs.” This unidimensionality is in stark difference to cities, who gain dimensions. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Next, West looked at the city as an analog of biological organisms. Through the lens of scaling theory, West claimed that “cities are an emergent self-organizing phenomenon that has resulted from the interaction and communication between human beings exchanging energy, resources, and information.” As such, cities should undergo the same nonlinear scaling as complex, self-sustaining biological organisms, and also exhibit systematic economies of scale. When we look at graphs of socioeconomic and infrastructural qualities of different cities, it becomes clear that infrastructure scales sublinearly with growth, and socioeconomic qualities scale superlinearly with growth. Not surprisingly, socioeconomic qualities with no analogs in biology also exhibited scaling in a systematic and regular fashion. With all of this in mind, it seems that in order to keep up the “infinite growth” we see in cities, we need to pay special attention to qualities that scale superlinearly, as these tend to be the qualities driving such growths. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Thirdly, West looked at social networks, another complex adaptive system intricately linked with human development. He drew a comparison between social networks and the biological networks that underlie quarter-power allometric scaling saying that both types of networks obeyed the same three rules: They are space filling, have invariant terminal units, and have evolved to be approximately optimal. West put special emphasis on this last rule, claiming that in urban social networks, social capital is maximized by optimizing social connections between individuals. This is comparable to biological organisms, where usable energy is maximized by optimizing metabolic functions. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;In the last chapter we read, Geoff West also considered the interplay between theory and big data. As an introduction, he discussed the Theory of Everything and the complexity of the Universe. He claimed that if a Theory of Everything did exist, then it would imply that the Universe is complicated, but not complex. He brought up the idea that Big Data could be a solution to many of the issues that plague us now. In consideration of the interplay between the advent of Big data and theory, West claims that having data is essential, but in terms of paradigm shifts, Big Data is more like an innovation on computation and simulation than a paradigm change. West goes further to claim that we put too much faith into machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics as methods of analysis for Big Data. His core message is that neither science nor data is democratic, and that scientists need to “have a well-developed, well-understood, well-tested conceptual framework and mathematical theory that guides us in where to look.”  This is in stark contrast to Rob Kitchen’s article. <br> <br>
