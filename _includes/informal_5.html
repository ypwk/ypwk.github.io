    &emsp;&emsp;At its core, human development is a complex adaptive system. In other words, the component social and economic systems that catalyze said development are self-similar and exhibit emergent behavior. In particular, the advent of data science and big data introduced effective methods of description and measurement that can be used to predict and analyze such systems. <br> <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;What is a complex adaptive system? In the 2012 Kapuscinski Lecture titled Development and Complexity, Owen Barder defined a complex adaptive system as one that exhibits emergent behavior, where a small change in input may lead to vastly different outputs. Constituents of this kind of system may follow simple rules, but the sum of interactions between simple components produce unexpected and complex overall behavior. This is what Barder meant by emergent behavior. Such a system tends towards complexity, and does not tend towards an equilibrium. Typically, such a system goes for long periods of time without change, and experiences sporadic, sudden changes. In the lecture, Barder pointed out that human development and biological evolution, both complex adaptive systems, both exhibit similar characteristics. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;The value of modelling and predicting such systems is evident. If such a system could be accurately modelled, it could be used as a guide to stimulate growth and development. The issue is, it is very difficult to make such a model with near-perfect accuracy. For one, creating complete simulations of these kinds of systems is computationally expensive, and when scaled up to represent large populations, it can become unreasonable. This is where big data and data science come in. Recent advances in data science and analysis of big data represent significant gains in our ability to describe, analyze, and predict human development processes. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;In his 2014 article “Big Data, New Epistemologies and Paradigm Shifts”, Rob Kitchen defines big data as “huge in volume, high in velocity, diverse in variety, exhaustive in scope, fine-grained in resolution, uniquely indexical in identification, relational in nature, flexible: able to be extended and scaled.” He also argued that the increasing availability of data of this caliber provided the impetus for the aforementioned advances in data science. Data science analyses can result in new perspectives and connect unrelated datum. Kitchen argues that any person who is trained to work with big data and data science is able to make these powerful analyses, leading to a paradigm shift where brute force analysis with big data overtakes theory as the top method to make advancements. Although this statement seems too drastic, a healthy middle ground would be that a correct utilization of data science can contribute to a more holistic understanding of any sociological, economical, or technological issue. Geoff West says as much in his book on scale. Big data is more like an innovation on computation and simulation than an actual paradigm change. West says that neither science nor data is democratic, and that scientists need to “have a well-developed, well-understood, well-tested conceptual framework and mathematical theory that guides us in where to look.” This is much closer to the truth. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Big data and data science can be used to analyze social, biological, and economic networks. Data science can be used to expose underlying patterns and connect previously unrelated concepts. Even though it is not currently computationally feasible to make comprehensive models of different complex adaptive systems, using big data and data science can serve as a useful approximation. Geoff West uses a somewhat similar approach to analyze complex adaptive systems in his book. He applied scaling laws to biological and economic entities, like organisms, cities, and businesses. <br> <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Even though data science can be powerful, it also has the potential to hurt. It could have unintended consequences or be used for the good of the few. For example, companies could use data science to find the most efficient way to exploit a population. Local social quirks could easily undo the goods a project has wrought. Even though there could be drawbacks to data science, as long as a project is developed with the correct context in mind, collaboration, and correct values, it is acceptable if it has some rough patches in the beginning. As long as development on the project continues with sights still set on the same good intent and collaborations still going strong, it will eventually succeed in changing lives for the better.<br> <br>
