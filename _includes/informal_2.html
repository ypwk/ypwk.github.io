    &emsp;&emsp;Although Big Data has the potential to push our understanding of the world even further than earlier sciences, as it stands right now, it is still preliminary in nature. It seems that analyses of big data are not yet sophisticated enough to approach the level of empiricism Kitchen describes in his 2014 article on Revolutions in Measurement: “wherein the volume of data, accompanied by techniques that can reveal their inherent truth, enables data to speak for themselves free of theory.” This theory is the bread and butter of advancing human knowledge of scientific fields. Without a contextualized and holistic understanding of any new process or scientific theory, it is difficult to make further progress. If at some point in the future, perhaps employing the power of artificial intelligence, data science is able to provide answers and contextualization to results, it has the potential to completely change the way science is done. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;The advent of big data serves as both catalyst and reactant for changes in measurement. Kitchen defines big data as huge in volume, high in velocity, diverse in variety, exhaustive in scope, fine-grained in resolution, uniquely indexical in identification, relational in nature, flexible: able to be extended and scaled. To analyze datasets of this quality and magnitude require adequate infrastructure and protocol, or changes in measurement. The recent deluge of data resulting from mass automation and development of online data collection services allows these changes and advancements in measurement to take place. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Data science, when applied to any discipline, can reveal hidden patterns or connections that are invisible to earlier methods of analysis.In other words, such analyses can result in altogether new perspectives and connect data that was until this point unrelated. Although it does not immediately result in a complete understanding of the process at hand, it can certainly help. Kitchen claims that any person who is trained to work with big data and data science is able to make these analyses, and this is certainly true. It seems that with data science as it is right now, correct utilization can contribute to a more holistic understanding of any issue, be it sociological, economical , or technological. Further developments, say utilizing Artificial Intelligence for analysis, could lead to vastly accelerated growth in a variety of fields. <br> <br>
