    &emsp;&emsp;In his article on the use of big data in developing countries, Blumenstock states that even though big data has the power to improve and change the lives of those living in poverty, there are a number of pitfalls that could invalidate that power. I think that even though using data science as an impetus for change can come with a side of unanticipated consequences, or be used for the good of the few when in the wrong hands, we need to recognize that Rome was not built in a day, that no one single data science project is going to completely fix a problem. Continued care, collaboration, and awareness are required to solve issues as complex as the ones we see in the third world. In other words, as long as a data science project is developed with the correct context in mind, collaboration, and correct values, it is acceptable if it has some rough patches in the beginning. As long as development on the project continues with sights still set on the same good intent and collaborations still going strong, it will eventually succeed in changing lives for the better. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;In his article, Blumenstock lists four different pitfalls for zealous data scientists: unanticipated effects, lack of validation, biased algorithms, and a lack of government regulations. These are all issues that can twist the outcome of data science applied to human development, regardless of the initial intent of the developers. Take, for example, the lack of government regulations about applications of data science. Currently, the power of big data is held in the hands of the wealthy, so a lack of government regulation could allow for rampant misuses of data science. In the same vein, the algorithms could be biased, because the means to produce and analyze big data is held in the hands of the wealthy. There is a very good chance that such analyses will not be made with human development in mind. Blumenstock also points out that the methods used to produce or analyze data could be inaccurate or ineffective, because there is not enough testing or research done about them. Lastly, cultural or social quirks could just undo the work of data science or even cause more harm than good. No single new technology comes without its drawbacks. These are just things that must be considered when developing new data science systems or methods of analysis. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;On the other hand, Blumenstock also lists three ways to address these concerns: validation with established datasets to keep any project on track, customization to fit the situation, and deeper collaborations to ensure the effectiveness of the project. Validating the new data sets with the old directly solves the problem with lack of validation Blumenstock mentions before. He also mentions customizing projects to fit the situation at hand, without which it is undoubtedly much easier to fall into the pitfall of unintended results. Deeper collaborations are also needed. These collaborations would give context to the applications of data science, further preventing unintended results from manifesting. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;I agree with Blumenstock that successful big data needs to be humbler. We need to recognize that data science is a two edged sword, with the potential to help and to harm. It certainly is not the cure-all that the media would have us believe. With misuse or unintended effects, data scientists have to take extreme caution when dealing with things as important and complex as human development. It has the power to ruin lives.
