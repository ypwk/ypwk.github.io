    &emsp;&emsp;In his lecture on Development and Complexity, Owen Barder defines development as an endogenous process, an emergent property of self-organizing complexity. In other words, he posits that development is akin to an evolutionary process, a complex adaptive system containing all the people, businesses, and governments in the world. It is a sometimes volatile process driven by economic, social, and political pressures that tends toward greater complexity and not towards any final equilibrium state. In contrast, this is Amartya Sen’s definition of development: “... enlarging people’s choices, capabilities and freedoms, so that they can live a long and healthy life, have access to knowledge, a decent standard of living, and participate in the life of their community.” Barder’s argument builds upon Sen’s by including a provision on complexity, something that is at the core of Barder’s idea of what development is. <br> <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;According to Barder, economic models created over the last fifty years have not been very effective at describing and predicting growth. Although we, over the last fifty years, have experienced incredible progress and growth, we do not have a way to explain why it happened. In his presentation, Barder included five examples of models and theories that just do not hold their water: the Harrod-Domar model, the Solow Model, the Washington Consensus, the Post-Washington Consensus, and Why Nations Fail. Each of these models hypothesized that a specific endogenous property of the socioeconomic system was responsible for development, but failed to explain why nations with similar initial states had such diverse outcomes. <br> <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;In an effort to explain how development is not a function of just one endogenous property of the system, Barder used the Toaster Project as an analogy. A decade ago, Thomas Thwaites attempted to build a toaster completely from scratch. He bought the cheapest toaster he could find and tried to replicate it with raw materials. In doing so, he bought iron ore and tried to smelt it into steel using his microwave, and made his own plastic. The final product was a lumpy, unreliable appliance that burst into flames after light use. In his own words, the project was a partial success. In undertaking this project, Thwaites uncovered an important part of development: to make something as simple as a toaster requires a whole array of materials and underlying infrastructure. To produce anything industrially requires political regulation, a workforce, and social and political institutions, just to name a few. Barder argues that this points towards a complex and nonlinear economy, and in turn, development. <br> <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;In the talk, Barder also used Steve Jones’ work at Unilever as an example. The engineers at Unilever were trying and failing to redesign a soap nozzle heavily used in production. This soap nozzle, though appearing simple, was a deceptively complicated system due to complex fluid mechanics. Steve Jones was an engineer hired to help redesign this soap nozzle. Jones used an evolutionary approach, making iterations of soap nozzles based on the most successful one in the previous iteration. Although he did not have an explanation for why his nozzle was better, it was a significant improvement over the one Unilever was using. <br> <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Barder used the Steve Jones example to lead into his explanation of a complex adaptive system. According to him, a complex adaptive system is one that exhibits emergent behavior, one where small changes in input can lead to vastly different outputs. It tends toward greater complexity, and does not tend towards an equilibrium. There are long periods of time without much change, and very fast, very significant changes in a short amount of time. According to Barder, development follows the rules of a complex adaptive system. <br> <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Even though development is under the constraints of a complex adaptive system, the rules can be bent by the people in power. Barder uses Ethiopia during the time of the Emperor as an example. Haile Sellasie was Ethiopia’s last emperor, and because at the time, it was to his benefit to suppress development in Ethiopia. Thus, he was able to halt development, which is one reason why Ethiopia is still developing today. <br> <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Although growth and development is a complex adaptive system, it is still a good idea to foster growth. Barder suggested implementing adaptive policies and institutions, as opposed to engineering static solutions. Institutions and policies that isomorphically mimic effective ones, ones that are not designed to adapt to their environment only appear to function, and only “mimic” the appearances of real effective institutions and policies. According to him, it is easier to create something that looks like it works than create something that actually works. Again, development is not a series of individual successes, but a property of the system as a whole. It is the emergence of self-organizing complexity. <br> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Even though development, with its complex adaptive characteristics, is very mechanical, we, the ones affected by it, don’t have to accept what it gives us. According to Barder, by “resisting fatalism”, we can accelerate and shape evolution to fit our needs. As to exactly what we should shape our evolution to be, and if we can do it effectively remains to be seen.
