# Personal Website and CV Generator

This project is a tool for personal documentation (along with my own personal website haha). It features a Python script that converts JSON data into both a LaTeX CV and a dynamic React website. The script ensures that updating your CV and website only requires changes to just one source file.

Use the following command to start the Next.js dev environment:
```cmd
npm run dev
```

TODO: 
- fix v-style compilation â€” finish transferring the style
